# ModelPerformance
Project to draw plots on corner number prediction model performance

There is a model that predicts number of corners in a room, for its floor and ceiling.

A class should be created to visualize corner prediction model performance.
Performance data is in json format which should be converted to a pandas dataframe.

Class should include draw_plots function that:
1. Creates plots that describe performance of the model, deviations in floor and ceiling predictions.
2. Saves plots in a 'plots' folder.

Class was created and can be viewed in 'Notebook.ipynb' file.
